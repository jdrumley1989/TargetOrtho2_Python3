# TargetOrtho2_Python3
Files for the Python3 version of TargetOrtho2

Provided here are files for using the Python3 version of TargetOrtho2.
Essentially the only thing that has been changed from the original version is that the code has been changed to Python3. 
This version has all of the same functionality as the command line version of the original TargetOrtho2.
For instructions on installing and running the Python3 version of TargetOrtho2, see the attached manuscript. (Will be present following publication)
For the original TargetOrtho2 developed by Glenwinkel et al., 2021 go to the following link: https://github.com/loriglenwinkel/TargetOrtho2.0
